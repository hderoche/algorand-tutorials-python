Sample code to create, opt-in, transfer, and read the balance of an asset on Algorand.

This repository contains the following files:

- `main.py`: contains the main functions to create, opt-in, and send the asset.
- `config.py`:  This will contain all of the configurable parameters. You will need to update this file for the functions in `main.py` to work.
- `util.py` - various utility functions.
- `LaylaGyoza.jpg` - This is an image of Layla the puppy that we will reference when we create our coin.
